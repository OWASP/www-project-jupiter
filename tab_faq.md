## FAQ

Q: Why is this project named "Jupiter"?

A: In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Discovery One embarked on a mission to investigate the signal sent from the monolith on the Moon to Jupiter. In 2010: The Year We Make Contact, the crews of the Discovery and Leonov witness countless monoliths emerge from Jupiter before it is converted into a star. Aside from the cool sci-fi reference, there is an analog to what this project is for -- to start with a small amount of information about software applications in an organization's portfolio and build upon that knowledge to find more.
